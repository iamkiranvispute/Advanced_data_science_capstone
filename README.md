### Prediction of default in banking products â€“ Credit Cards

Any financial crunch in an organization or customers personal profile is over a period of time. There are indicators which can be used to anticipate the final outcome, such as late payments, calls to the customer services, enquiries about the products, a different browsing pattern on the web or mobile app. By using such patterns it is possible to prevent, or at least guide the process and provide a better service for the customer as well as reduced risks for the bank.
The goal of this project is to predict credit cards defaulting cases with the help of statistics, machine learning and deep learning. By applying the right algorithm and parameters we can get a prediction on the 5th month or even 4th month to know if the customer have high chance of getting his credit card defaulted.

The database used for amnalysis is an open-source data base from Kaggle:

This repository contains following files:

1. Database.csv (Credit_Card_base.csv)
2. Python notebook for model (Credit card model)

The Goal is to train a model with the capability to minimize the risk by making predictions based on the dataset.
Post training the model is successfully able to evaluate the likelihood of credit default by a customer.
